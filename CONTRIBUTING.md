# Translation
There is a lot to do here. The major problem is that the translation scheme is not yet finished.
You have to start from the French translation to go to the other languages.

# Contributing code
## Steps
1. First, ensure you have a GitHub account and [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository.

3. Submit a new [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
